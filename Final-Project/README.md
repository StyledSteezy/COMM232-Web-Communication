# Final Project
For the final project I planned and executed a web site of minimally three pages. The focus/topic of the website was up to me. 

## Project Requirements
1. Site plan – Describe the site strategy including site objectives and target users. Include a checklist of the content
that you plan to include. Research available domain names and find one that you would be able to use if you
were creating the site.
2. Homepage wireframe created with your choice of tool.
3. Website elements
    - HTML pages
      - Correct HTML structure
      - Your home page file should be named “index.html”
      - Additional files should have names descriptive of what they are. Example – “contact.html”, “about-us.html”
    - External stylesheet
      - Your stylesheet should be named “styles.css”
    - Images
      - Include alt tags
    - Directory structure – Your root folder should be named “public_html”. Within that folder create these sub-folders.
      - images
      - textfiles
      - styles
    - Your “index.html” file should be in the root folder. Place your additional html pages in the “textfiles” folder.
    
## Site Plan
The website will be called ‘Open Worlds Community’.

The strategy for my website is to make a relatively simple and straightforward site that will help
gamers find the game that is right for them. The site will have information on individual games
that the user can read which will give them a better understanding of the game.

The objective for the site will be giving a list of games and a description of each game and some
overview on how each game is different from the others. At the end of each description, there is
a like to the games website so the user can easily find more information about the game or
actually download the game. Because the site is so new it only has 1 list of games right now.
Because there are so many different genres of games I wanted to pick one specific one, MMOs.
This would be something that could be updated later on in the website; adding more games.

The target users for this site will be gamers who are looking to find information about games.
